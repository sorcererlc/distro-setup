# Linux distro setup utility

This tool is meant to be used on a minimal Linux to install desired packages and perform initial configuration automatically.
It was born out of my need to replicate a desktop setup on multiple machines.

The included YAML files will set up Hyprland or Sway window manager with Waybar and some other utilities to make it a fully working lightweight desktop system.

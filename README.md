# Linux distro setup utility

### Purpose

This tool is meant to be used on a minimal Linux to install desired packages and perform initial configuration automatically. It was born out of my need to replicate a desktop setup on multiple machines.

The included YAML files will set up Hyprland or Sway as a window manager with Waybar and some other utilities to make it a fully functional lightweight desktop system.

### Why go instead of bash scripts?

While the result is the same and, indeed, everything this tool does is done via shell commands, I find working with configuration files and performing more complex programming tasks easier with a proper programming language compared to bash scripts. Also, I'm a big proponent of compiled vs. interpreted languages in general :)
